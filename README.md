# OLYMPIC
A digital coin built on the plygon chain
I. Safe and Efficient Ethereum Side-Chain Foundation

As a kind of Token deployed on the Ethereum side-chain Polygon (formerly known as Matic Network), OLYMPIC directly inherits the security level of Ethereum, ensuring a stable and reliable trading environment. Its economic model design is particularly prominent, with a transaction fee as low as 0.001 US dollars. Compared with the high transaction cost of Ethereum itself, this advantage can almost be ignored, greatly promoting the trading enthusiasm of users and the economic vitality of the platform.

II. Global Participation Potential Under the Olympic Theme

OLYMPIC cleverly combines itself with the world's most influential sports event - the Olympic Games, potentially reaching a huge participant group of billions of people. With this unique theme, OLYMPIC can not only quickly attract global attention but also has the potential to become the most watched digital currency in a short time and lead a new trend of value exchange.

III. Innovative High-Deflation Mechanism to Ensure Value Appreciation

OLYMPIC implements a strict deflation strategy and plans to destroy 80% of the total amount to ensure the long-term scarcity and value increase of the Token. The specific implementation steps are as follows:

First, 40% of the Tokens will be destroyed after the end of the Summer Olympics in 2024;
Immediately after, with the end of the 2024 Paralympic Games, another 20% will be destroyed;
Finally, during the Winter Olympics in 2026, the remaining 20% of the destruction work will be completed.

This destruction process will be executed at 24:00 (UTC time) every day during each event schedule to ensure that the destruction operation is synchronized with the event process. More importantly, the details of each Token destruction will be recorded and made public on ploygonscan.com, ensuring the high transparency and verifiability of the entire process. The number of Tokens to be destroyed will be proportional to the number of gold, silver, and bronze medals awarded during the event. In this unique way to celebrate the achievements of athletes, and by systematically reducing the circulation, it is expected that the value of OLYMPIC will increase by at least four times, fully demonstrating the forward-looking and value-driven potential of its deflation model.

To sum up, the OLYMPIC digital currency white paper shows a grand vision aiming to link the global sports spirit with the future of digital finance by emphasizing its safe and efficient underlying technology, global participation theme, and innovative deflation value promotion strategy, presenting an unlimited potential development blueprint for investors and users.
